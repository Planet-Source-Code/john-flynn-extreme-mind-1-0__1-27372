### Description

Extreme Mind is a game where the user tries to figure out a random code created by the computer. This board game is based on a game I played as a child called Mastermind. I have seen a couple attempts to re-create this game (on PSC) for the computer but I personally didn't like any of the ones I found, so I wrote my own, and I give it to you.<P>

Please, Please, Please Vote and leave as many comments as possible because I have only been programming since March 2001 and using VB since July 2001, so the more comments the better.<P>

Some interesting things in this code are:<BR>

-Generating random numbers with no duplicates<BR>

-Scanning the user's code for duplicates<BR>

-Using Random Access Data Files<BR>

-Remembering settings<BR>

-Checking the user's code (pretty involved)<BR>

-Image swapping<BR>

-Using Sounds<BR>

-Sending an .html file to the default browser<BR>

And much much more...
