        Welcome to Extreme Mind 1.0. This game is a clone of my most favorite board
        game I played as a child named &quot;Mastermind&quot; that was made by
        Pressman®, although I have heard it was made by other companies too. In
        writing this game I have tried to make it resemble the original in look and
        playability as much as possible.

        <p>This program is comment ware, if you use it please send a postcard with your
        comments to:

        <p>If you are a little too cheap to buy the post card then please send me an
        <a href="mailto:johnnyflynn@hotmail.com">E-Mail</a> with &quot;Extreme Mind&quot;
        in the subject line (so it doesn't get filtered out as junk), and your home
        town in the message (so I can see how far around the world I've reached).

        <p>In case you are wondering I have only been programming for 6 months as of
        the release of this program. I started in March of 2001 with C and then moved
        on to C++ then Java and finally Visual BASIC. This program is written in Visual
        BASIC, mostly because I don't yet know enough about the Windows API (Application
        Programming Interface) to write it in C++. Depending on how the people who
        download this version like it, it may be re-written in C++ when I know enough
        about the API to do so. Your comments will be a big part of wether or not this
        happens and what could possibly be added to this version.

        <p>Thank you for downloading my game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed
        writing it.<br>
        John Flynn
