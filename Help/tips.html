        <p>When playing the game you can click on any empty spot and the last
        color peg that was used will be placed in that spot. If you click on a
        spot that already has a peg in it then it will not replace that peg,
        instead it will change the active peg to that color. <br>
        <b>Example:</b> If you drop a white peg and then drop a black peg clicking on
        one of the empty spots will place a black peg in the empty spot. If you
        now click on the white peg that was dropped and then click the last
        empty spot Extreme Mind will place a white peg in that spot.

        <p>Playing on Extreme will give Extreme Mind the ability to leave some
        pegs empty. If you are playing the game and drop a peg in a spot that
        you meant to leave empty you can easily remove the peg by either double
        clicking it or just right clicking the peg. When a peg is removed the
        avtive peg becomes the color of the peg removed.<br>
        <b>Example:</b> You first drop a black peg, then a blue peg, next a red
        peg, and finally a yellow peg. Right clicking (or double clicking) the
        black peg will remove it. Now right clicking (or double clicking) the
        blue peg will remove it as well. Clicking on one of the two empty spots
        now will place a blue peg in that spot. Now you could also click the red
        peg and then click the last empty spot and a red peg will be placed in
        that spot.
